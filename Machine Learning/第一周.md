### 1.1-Welcome

#### 1.1.1-Machine Learning Honor Code

We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including **in-video questions**). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the answers that you submit for the **review questions** should be your own work. For the **programming exercises**, you are welcome to discuss them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students.

#### Guidelines for Posting Code in Discussion Forums

Scenario 1: Code to delete

Learner Question/Comment: "Here is the code I have so far, but it fails the grader. Please help me fix it."

**Why Delete?**: The reason is that if there is a simple fix provided by a student, a quick copy and paste with a small edit will provide credit without individual effort.

Learner Question: A student substitutes words for the math operators, but includes the variable names (or substitutes the equivalent greek letters (θ for 'theta', etc). This student also provides a sentence-by-sentence, line by line, description of exactly what their code implements. "The first line of my script has the equation "hypothesis equals theta times X", but I get the following error message...".

**Why Delete?**: This should be deleted. “Spelling out” the code in English is the same as using the regular code.

Scenario 2: Code not to delete

Learner Question: How do I subset a matrix to eliminate the intercept?

Mentor Response: This probably would be okay, especially if the person posting makes an effort to not use familiar variable names, or to use a context which has nothing to do with the contexts in the assignments.

It is clearly ok to show examples of Octave code to demonstrate a technique. Even if the technique itself is directly applicable to a programming problem at hand. As long as what is typed cannot be "cut and pasted" into the program at hand.

E.g. how do I set column 1 of a matrix to zero? Try this in your Octave work area:

```
>> A = magic(3)

>> A(:,1) = 0
```

The above is always acceptable (in my understanding). Demonstrating techniques and learning the language/syntax are important Forum activities.

### 1.2-Introduction

#### 1.2.1-What is Machine Learning?

Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. Arthur Samuel described it as: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition.

Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

Example: playing checkers.

E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

T = the task of playing checkers.

P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:

Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.


#### 1.2.2-How to Use Discussion Forums

###### Upvoting Posts

When you enter the discussion forum for your course, you will see an Upvote button under each post. We encourage you to upvote posts you find thoughtful, interesting, or helpful. This is the best way to ensure that quality posts will be seen by other learners in the course. Upvoting will also increase the likelihood that important questions get addressed and answered.

###### Report Abuse

###### Coursera's Code of Conduct prohibits:

- Bullying or threatening other users
- Posting spam or promotional content
- Posting mature content
- Posting assignment solutions (or other violations of the Honor Code) 

Please report any posts that infringe upon copyright or are abusive, offensive, or that otherwise violate Coursera’s Honor Code by using the Report this option found under the menu arrow to the right of each post.

###### Following

If you find a particular thread interesting, click the Follow button under the original post of that thread page. When you follow a post, you will receive an email notification anytime a new post is made.

##### Improving Your Posts

Course discussion forums are your chance to interact with thousands of like-minded individuals around the world. Getting their attention is one way to do well in this course. In any social interaction, certain rules of etiquette are expected and contribute to more enjoyable and productive communication. The following are tips for interacting in this course via the forums, adapted from guidelines originally compiled by AHA! and Chuq Von Rospach & Gene Spafford:

1. Stay on topic in existing forums and threads. Off-topic posts make it hard for other learners to find information they need. Post in the most appropriate forum for your topic, and do not post the same thing in multiple forums.
2. Use the filters at the top of the forum page (**Latest, Top**, and **Unanswered**) to find active, interesting content.
3. **Upvote** posts that are helpful and interesting.
4. Be civil. If you disagree, explain your position with respect and refrain from any and all personal attacks.
5. Stay on topic. In particular, don’t change the subject in the middle of an existing thread – just start a new topic.
6. Make sure you’re understood, even by non-native English speakers. Try to write full sentences, and avoid text-message abbreviations or slang. Be careful when you use humor and sarcasm as these messages are easy to misinterpret.
7. If asking a question, provide as much information as possible, what you’ve already considered, what you’ve already read, etc.
8. Cite appropriate references when using someone else’s ideas, thoughts, or words.
9. Do not use a forum to promote your product, service, or business.
10. Conclude posts by inviting other learners to extend the discussion. For example, you could say “I would love to understand what others think.”
11. Do not post personal information about other posters in the forum.
12. Ignore spammers and report them.


For more details, refer to Coursera's Forum Code of Conduct.

These tips and tools for interacting in this course via the forums were adapted from guidelines originally by The University of Illinois.

#### 1.2.3-Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.

Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems. In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.

**Example 1:**

Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict their price. Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a regression problem.

We could turn this example into a classification problem by instead making our output about whether the house "sells for more or less than the asking price." Here we are classifying the houses based on price into two discrete categories.

**Example 2:**

(a) Regression - Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture

(b) Classification - Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

#### 1.2.4-Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.

We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.

With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.

**Example:**

Clustering: Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.

Non-clustering: The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment. (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at a cocktail party).

#### 1.2.5-Who are Mentors?

**Mentor Program Overview:**

Community Mentors are successful, dedicated Coursera learners who volunteer to assist with support and discussion forum moderation in courses that they have already completed. They have been recruited by Coursera to encourage newer learners, answer questions, set an example by posting thoughtful and timely content, and report platform bugs and inappropriate content to Coursera.

As you use the discussion areas, please be aware that the ideas expressed by participants in this course, including the Mentors, do not represent the views of Stanford University. The mentors are not employed by Stanford University and they have not been vetted by Stanford University as experts on course content or course facilitation.

#### 1.2.7-Frequently Asked Questions
The following Machine Learning Mentors volunteered time to compile this list of Frequently Asked Questions: Colin Beckingham, Kevin Burnham, Maxim Haytovich, Tom Mosher, Richard Gayle, Simon Crase, Michael Reardon and Paul Mielke.

Be sure to thank them when you see them in the discussion forums!

##### General Questions

**Q: Is the grader server down?**  
A: First step is to check here.

**Q: The audio in the videos is quite bad sometimes, muffled or low volume. Please fix it.**  
A: You can mitigate the audio issues by turning down the bass and up the treble if you have those controls, or using a headset, which naturally emphasizes the higher frequencies. Also you may want to switch on the English closed captioning. It is unlikely to be fixed in the near term because most students do not have serious problems and therefore it is low on the priority list.

**Q: What does it mean when I see “Math Processing Error?”**  
A: The page is attempting to use MathJax to render math symbols. Sometimes the content delivery network can be sluggish or you have caught the web page Ajax javascript code in an incomplete state. Normally just refreshing the page to make it load fully fixes the problem

**Q: How can I download lectures?**  
A: On Demand videos cannot be downloaded. However, you may find the videos from a previous version of the course here.

**Q: Is there a prerequisite for this course?**  
A: Students are expected to have the following background:

- Knowledge of basic computer science principles and skills, at a level sufficient to write a reasonably non-trivial computer program.
- Familiarity with the basic probability theory.
- Familiarity with the basic linear algebra. 

**Q: Why do we have to use Matlab or Octave? Why not Clojure, Julia, Python, R or [Insert favourite language here]?**  
A: As Prof. Ng explained in the 1st video of the Octave tutorial, he has tried teaching Machine Learning in a variety of languages, and found that students come up to speed faster with Matlab/Octave. Therefore the course was designed using Octave/Matlab, and the automatic submission grader uses those program interfaces. Octave and Matlab are optimized for rapid vectorized calculations, which is very useful in Machine Learning. R is a nice tool, but:

1.	It is a bit too high level. This course shows how to actually implement the algorithms of machine learning, while R already has them implemented. Since the focus of this course is to show you what happens in ML algorithms under the hood, you need to use Octave 2.	This course offers some starter code in Octave/Matlab, which will really save you tons of time solving the tasks.

**Q: I'm viewing through Coursera and don't see sample problems or assignments I can use to practice the material from the course?**  
A: You can view sample problems here.

**Q: How can I get the written lecture notes of the topics going in the course?**  
A: You may find the notes from a previous version of the course here.

**Q: Has anyone figured out the how to solve this problem?**  
Here is my code [Insert code]. A: This is a violation of the Coursera Honor Code. Find the Honor Code here.

**Q: I've submitted correct answers for [insert problem]. However I would like to compare my implementation with other who did correctly.**  
A: This is a violation of the Coursera Honor Code. Find the Honor Code here.

**Q: This is my email: [insert email]. Can we get the answer for the quiz?**  
A: This is a violation of the Coursera Honor Code. Find the Honor Code here.

**Q: Do I receive a certificate once I complete this course?**  
A: Course Certificate is available in this course. Click here to learn about how Course Certificate works and how to purchase.

**Q: Lots of the material in the Wiki is out of date. Whose responsibility is it to fix it?**  
A: Yours: the Wiki is student maintained. If you see something is wrong, you can fix it if you are inclined to.

**Q: Why do all the answers in a multiple correct question say correct response when you submit the answer to an in-video question?**   
A: Coursera's software is designed to suggest the correctness of each state of the check box. Therefore, an answer having a correct answer tag below it means that the state of that check box is correct.

**Q: What is the correct technique of entering a numeric answer to a text box question ?**  
A: Coursera's software for numeric answers only supports '.' as the decimal delimiter (not ',') and require that fractions be simplified to decimals. For answers with many decimal digits, please use a 2 digits after decimal point rounding method when entering solutions if not mentioned in the question.

**Q: What is the correct technique of entering a 1 element matrix ?**  
A: They should be entered as just the element without brackets.

**Q: What does a A being a 3 element vector or a 3 dimensional vector mean?**  
A: If not described a vector as mentioned in the questions is A=⎡⎣element1element2element3⎤⎦.

**Q: I think I found an error in a video. What should I do?**  
A: First, check the errata section of the Course Wiki. If you do not find the error listed, then add it there. If you are unsure if it is an error, create a new thread in the discussion forum describing the error.

**Q: My quiz grade displayed is wrong or I have a verification issue or I cannot retake a quiz. What should I do?**  
A: Contact learner support. These queries can only be resolved by learner support and it is best if they are contacted directly. Do not flag such issues.

## 2-Linear Regression with One Variable

### 2.1-Model and Cost Function
#### 2.1.1-Model Representation

![](http://i1.piimg.com/567571/931234bc017f7ab4.png)

#### 2.1.2-Cost Function
![](http://i1.piimg.com/567571/111a26da17afdd00.png)
![](http://i1.piimg.com/567571/7079474c8c39f0d9.png)

#### 2.1.3-Cost Function - Intuition I

If we try to think of it in visual terms, our training data set is scattered on the x-y plane. We are trying to make a straight line (defined by **hθ(x)**) which passes through these scattered data points.

Our objective is to get the best possible line. The best possible line will be such so that the average squared vertical distances of the scattered points from the line will be the least. Ideally, the line should pass through all the points of our training data set. In such a case, the value of **J(θ0,θ1)** will be 0. The following example shows the ideal situation where we have a cost function of 0.

![](http://i1.piimg.com/567571/19812f9c45e6bc90.png)

When **θ1=1**, we get a slope of 1 which goes through every single data point in our model. Conversely, when **θ1=0.5**, we see the vertical distance from our fit to the data points increase.

![](http://i1.piimg.com/567571/dd08e9a59c1e7f4d.png)

This increases our cost function to 0.58. Plotting several other points yields to the following graph:

![](http://i1.piimg.com/567571/62e5c3a7f3ddbab1.png)

Thus as a goal, we should try to minimize the cost function. In this case, **θ1=1** is our global minimum.


#### 2.1.4-Cost Function - Intuition II
A contour plot is a graph that contains many contour lines. A contour line of a two variable function has a constant value at all points of the same line. An example of such a graph is the one to the right below.

![](http://p1.bqimg.com/567571/ed1b2e9a939bc72b.png)

Taking any color and going along the 'circle', one would expect to get the same value of the cost function. For example, the three green points found on the green line above have the same value for **J(θ0,θ1)** and as a result, they are found along the same line. The circled x displays the value of the cost function for the graph on the left when **θ0** = 800 and **θ1**= -0.15. Taking another h(x) and plotting its contour plot, one gets the following graphs:

![](http://p1.bqimg.com/567571/ffc931f98586bf2d.png)

When **θ0** = 360 and **θ1** = 0, the value of **J(θ0,θ1)** in the contour plot gets closer to the center thus reducing the cost function error. Now giving our hypothesis function a slightly positive slope results in a better fit of the data.

![](http://p1.bqimg.com/567571/338e413e102a7ef7.png)

The graph above minimizes the cost function as much as possible and consequently, the result of **θ1** and **θ0** tend to be around 0.12 and 250 respectively. Plotting those values on our graph to the right seems to put our point in the center of the inner most 'circle'.

---

### 2.2-Parameter Learning
#### 2.2.1-Gradient Descent
So we have our hypothesis function and we have a way of measuring how well it fits into the data. Now we need to estimate the parameters in the hypothesis function. That's where gradient descent comes in.

Imagine that we graph our hypothesis function based on its fields **θ0** and **θ1** (actually we are graphing the cost function as a function of the parameter estimates). We are not graphing x and y itself, but the parameter range of our hypothesis function and the cost resulting from selecting a particular set of parameters.

We put **θ0** on the x axis and **θ1** on the y axis, with the cost function on the vertical z axis. The points on our graph will be the result of the cost function using our hypothesis with those specific theta parameters. The graph below depicts such a setup.
![](http://p1.bqimg.com/567571/770db08efa96fbae.png)

We will know that we have succeeded when our cost function is at the very bottom of the pits in our graph, i.e. when its value is the minimum. The red arrows show the minimum points in the graph.

The way we do this is by taking the derivative (the tangential line to a function) of our cost function. The slope of the tangent is the derivative at that point and it will give us a direction to move towards. We make steps down the cost function in the direction with the steepest descent. The size of each step is determined by the parameter α, which is called the learning rate.

For example, the distance between each 'star' in the graph above represents a step determined by our parameter α. A smaller α would result in a smaller step and a larger α results in a larger step. The direction in which the step is taken is determined by the partial derivative of **J(θ0,θ1)**. Depending on where one starts on the graph, one could end up at different points. The image above shows us two different starting points that end up in two different places.

The gradient descent algorithm is:

repeat until convergence: 

![](http://p1.bqimg.com/567571/5f25d339c3dbcf5a.png)

where

j=0,1 represents the feature index number.

At each iteration j, one should simultaneously update the parameters **θ1,θ2,...,θn**. Updating a specific parameter prior to calculating another one on the **j(th)** iteration would yield to a wrong implementation.

![](http://p1.bqimg.com/567571/9235d825e89cbd8b.png)

#### 2.2.2-Gradient Descent Intuition

In this video we explored the scenario where we used one parameter **θ1** and plotted its cost function to implement a gradient descent. Our formula for a single parameter was :

Repeat until convergence:

![](http://p1.bqimg.com/567571/a72a341bce544162.png)

![](http://p1.bqimg.com/567571/b4a87966eca6c884.png)

![](http://p1.bqimg.com/567571/94e6408c7431265e.png)

On a side note, we should adjust our parameter α to ensure that the gradient descent algorithm converges in a reasonable time. Failure to converge or too much time to obtain the minimum value imply that our step size is wrong.

![](http://p1.bqimg.com/567571/3f539f0f077d4216.png)

![](http://p1.bqimg.com/567571/354b9bd3fc85b15b.png)

![](http://p1.bqimg.com/567571/12535b3fab187ff1.png)

#### 2.2.3-Gradient Descent For Linear Regression

When specifically applied to the case of linear regression, a new form of the gradient descent equation can be derived. We can substitute our actual cost function and our actual hypothesis function and modify the equation to :

![](http://p1.bqimg.com/567571/6c538a603b4d803d.png)
![](http://i1.piimg.com/567571/2293f18c9a7e6881.png)

The point of all this is that if we start with a guess for our hypothesis and then repeatedly apply these gradient descent equations, our hypothesis will become more and more accurate.

So, this is simply gradient descent on the original cost function J. This method looks at every example in the entire training set on every step, and is called **batch gradient descent**. Note that, while gradient descent can be susceptible to local minima in general, the optimization problem we have posed here for linear regression has only one global, and no other local, optima; thus gradient descent always converges (assuming the learning rate α is not too large) to the global minimum. Indeed, J is a convex quadratic function. Here is an example of gradient descent as it is run to minimize a quadratic function.

![](http://i1.piimg.com/567571/272f1f03041e9a98.png)

The ellipses shown above are the contours of a quadratic function. Also shown is the trajectory taken by gradient descent, which was initialized at (48,30). The x’s in the figure (joined by straight lines) mark the successive values of θ that gradient descent went through as it converged to its minimum.

### 2.3-Review
#### 2.3.1-Lecture Slides
#### 2.3.2-Linear Regression with One Variable

1.Consider the problem of predicting how well a student does in her second year of college/university, given how well she did in her first year.

Specifically, let x be equal to the number of "A" grades (including A-. A and A+ grades) that a student receives in their first year of college (freshmen year). We would like to predict the value of y, which we define as the number of "A" grades they get in their second year (sophomore year).

Here each row is one training example. Recall that in linear regression, our hypothesis is hθ(x)=θ0+θ1x, and we use m to denote the number of training examples.

![](http://i1.piimg.com/567571/0a0da8b48f1f5f6c.png)

For the training set given above (note that this training set may also be referenced in other questions in this quiz), what is the value of m? In the box below, please enter your answer (which should be a number between 0 and 10).

2.Many substances that can burn (such as gasoline and alcohol) have a chemical structure based on carbon atoms; for this reason they are called hydrocarbons. A chemist wants to understand how the number of carbon atoms in a molecule affects how much energy is released when that molecule combusts (meaning that it is burned). The chemist obtains the dataset below. In the column on the right, “kJ/mol” is the unit measuring the amount of energy released.

![](http://i1.piimg.com/567571/6e7e25617826c9e6.png)

You would like to use linear regression (hθ(x)=θ0+θ1x) to estimate the amount of energy released (y) as a function of the number of carbon atoms (x). Which of the following do you think will be the values you obtain for θ0 and θ1? You should be able to select the right answer without actually implementing linear regression.
